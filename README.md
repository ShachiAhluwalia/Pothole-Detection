# Pothole Detection using YOLO ðŸš§  

## Overview  
This project implements **pothole detection** using **YOLO** to identify and localize potholes in road images. The model is trained on a dataset from **Kaggle** and provides bounding boxes around detected potholes, making it useful for road safety and maintenance applications.  

## Features  
- **YOLO-based object detection** for real-time pothole identification  
- **Bounding boxes** to highlight detected potholes  
- **Preprocessing** applied to improve model accuracy  
- **Dataset sourced from Kaggle** and handled programmatically (download/unzip via code)  

## Dataset  
- The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and contains labeled images of potholes.  
- It includes annotations in YOLO format for training the model effectively.  

## Installation  
To set up the project, follow these steps:  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pothole-detection-yolo.git  
cd pothole-detection-yolo  

# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS  
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows  

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Setup  
Run the following script to download and extract the dataset from Kaggle:  

```python
import os
import zipfile
from kaggle.api.kaggle_api_extended import KaggleApi

# Initialize Kaggle API
api = KaggleApi()
api.authenticate()

# Define dataset path
dataset = "your-kaggle-dataset-name"
download_path = "data/"

# Download dataset
api.dataset_download_files(dataset, path=download_path, unzip=True)

print("Dataset downloaded and extracted successfully!")
```

Make sure you have your Kaggle API key set up in `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`.

## Training the Model  
1. Prepare the dataset in the required YOLO format.  
2. Use the following command to train the model:  

```bash
python train.py --data data.yaml --epochs 50 --batch-size 16 --img-size 640 --weights yolov5s.pt
```

3. Evaluate model performance using:  

```bash
python detect.py --weights best.pt --source test_images/
```

## Results  
- Achieved **[XX]% accuracy** on test data  
- Model can detect potholes with **high precision and recall**  

## Future Improvements  
- Enhance dataset diversity for better generalization  
- Deploy the model using Flask/FastAPI for real-time detection  
- Optimize model performance for edge devices
